# Hardhat test

​
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
​
Try running this for different test cases:
​

```shell
npx hardhat test        //run all test cases
npm run sale            //run test cases of sale contract
npm run nftsale         //run test cases of nft sale contract
npm run singlesale      //run test cases of single sale contract
npm run singlesalev2    //run test cases of single sale v2 contract
npm run governancenft   //run test cases of governancenft contract
npm run seednft         //run test cases of seednft contract
```
